For all items were created prefabs. 


There is 3 ways to equip character.
If you want to equip item you have to:

Method 1. Place NPC_MainPrefab on the scene and delete unwanted parts like hat or tool and change material.

Method 2. Place NPC_Empty add prefab(items) on the slots (you can filter model (by "slot") to find slots in character hierarchy) :
Hair, Beards, Hats - Head_slot
Tools - WeaponSlot OR WeaponSlotPelvis
Bags - In main gameobject you have 6 NPC_Backet, unhide and change material if you want. 

If you have 11k Animated Fantasy Heroes you can use these slots to eguip weapons and items. 
Bracers - Bracers_slot (left and right)
Shoulders - Shoulders_slot (left and right)
Helmets - Head_slot
Shields, Bows - ShieldBow_Slot 
Swords - WeaponSlot

Method 3. Place any character prefab and only change item mesh and material.
You can easily create a scripts to equip items on events (pick up item, equipment interface...) just changing parent to 'Item'_Slot. For character you only need to change material.
